# React 🤝 Phoenix 🤝 TypeScript

A [Phoenix framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) app with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as its frontend.

> [!NOTE]  
> **This repo is archived, but the philosophy here still stands. If you want to replicate this setup on any Web framework, [give my blogpost a read here](https://bpaulino.com/entries/modern-webapps-with-elixir-phoenix-typescript-react).**

## Phoenix Backend

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
* Start the Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## React frontend

For developing the frontend:

* `cd` into the frontend directory
* Install all dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the dev server with `npm run dev`

Now you can visit [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) from your browser.
